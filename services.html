                <h4>Roof Renovations</h4>
                <img loading="lazy" src="./assets/images/renovations.jpg" alt="">
                <p>It is unfortunate that no roof lasts forever, but, fortunately, we are there to renovate it for you!</p>
                <h5>Signs You May Need Your Roof Renovated</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h6>Damaged Shingles</h6>
                        <p>
                            Probably the most notable red flag for roof inspection is when you see damaged or missing shingles on your roof.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h6>Gutter Health</h6>
                        <p>
                            Did you you know your gutter systems can say a whole lot about about your roof? While it is normal to find leaves and other occassional debris in your gutter, it is not OK to notice granules.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h6>Saging Roof</h6>
                        <p>
                            A roof should be strong and rigid to protect your home and family. Every component needs to be in place and none of them dhould be heavily damaged or missing.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h6>Leaks</h6>
                        <p>
                            It usually occurs when shingles fall off and allow water to flow through the cracks. Just beacause you haven't seen a leak doesn't mean there isn't one.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    When you notice any of these red flags, do not hesitate to call us. "When it comes to roofs, it is always better to fix things sooner than later!"

            Swimming Pool maintenance is the back bone of the healthy swimming pool. Regularly cleaning your pool is one of them. But there are other things that you need to keep in mind. Your swimming pool may not be safe from harmful disease and bacteria without regular maintenance, especially properly balancing the water and ensuring proper filtration and circulation. For instance, balancing its pH levels and sanitizing it with chlorine are also part of your pool maintenance.

            While it can be time-consuming and difficult to understand, keeping your pool clean and healthy can be done by professionals who know exactly how to maintain your pool and prevent it from any damage.
